    "The resulting maps shows variation in prices based on the proximity to the city centre, as well a few other clusters of high prices (e.g. to the West and North-East). These clusters show locations that accommodation offered has high spatial autocorrelation in terms of prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial autocorrelation measures can be computed with a number of measures; this measures can look at relationships globally (e.g. if the spatial pattern of the dataset as a whole is randomly distributed in space or not), such as with [Moran's I statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moran%27s_I), or locally (e.g. if clusters of similar values are observed but without homogeneity) such as with Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) or Getis-Ord (Gi*) statistics. Generally, computing a _spatial weights matrix_ is  essential in order to carry out these measurements. Package `spdep` has a lot of functions that can be useful when exploring spatial dependencies.\n",
