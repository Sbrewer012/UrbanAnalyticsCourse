    "## Interaction data\n",
    "The dynamics of urban systems are captured by various types of interaction data with varying degrees of spatio-temporal granularity. In this practical you will explore various ways in which interaction data can be mapped; including the estimation and representation of routes from co-ordinate pairs, mapping GPS trails and how very large origin-destination flows can be summarized.\n",

    "## Estimating and representing routes\n",
    "Many interaction data within cities are simply pairs of origin and destination locations, with some flow recorded between them. A good source of such data which are available within many municipalities relate to the location and flow between bike share docking stations. Many of the operators of these systems now make these data openly available.\n",
