    "* Build graph / network objects within R that feature vertex and edge attributes\n",
    "* Create graph / network  plots with various layout types\n",

    "## Cities of flow\n",
    "We have already covered the various ways in which flow data can be visualized, however, it is increasingly common within urban analytics to build networks from these data or their subsets, and to use graph / network analysis techniques to create summary measures of their structure that help thinking about positioning of entities within systems. These networks may relate to flows between zones, physical networks such as transit systems or the geolocation of individuals within social networks.\n",

We illustrate this in the following plot, however, in most urban applications where the networks are very dense, these can often be confusing and offer limiting visual analytic impact. In this example we have adjusted a series plot options including only plotting flows greater than 20 using delete.edges() and which(), setting a small vertex size and edge width, and adding transparency to the edge color with the adjustcolor() function. Additionally, because this is a directed network (i.e. flows can go in both directions) we have set this mode to off - this ensures that no arrows are plotted.
