    "##Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this practical lab you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn how R can be used for web analysis\n",
    "2. Have the skills to utilize web mapping servers to provide contextual detail for maps within R\n",
    "3. Use geocoding and routing functionality to plot locations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This practical lab concerns integrating the web with R, both as a source of data or as an analytics platform. These connections utilize Application Programming Interfaces (API) which enable data queries or analytics to be run, returning the results within R. Much of the complexity to these interfaces are hidden by the R packages that will be demonstrated here and therefore are quite accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading data from the web\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest ways in which you can read data from the web is by using some of the same functionality for reading local files. For example, we can read a CSV file of [municipal swimming pool locations in Brisbane, Australia](https://www.data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/data/dataset/swimming-pools) as follows:"
